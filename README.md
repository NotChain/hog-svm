# HoG-SVM
This is decent at detecting stop signs. :)
The code is commented to give all the necessary information, what I put here is the trained SVM and the main code. 
The code is tested by running a video that I have in a folder called "Set2", which I cannot upload here due to size and whatnot.

The libraries used are:
joblib, numpy and opencv

These are mandatory for the program to work. Yes.
